Website of Wonderful Banten

<p>Background</P> 

This website created to fulfil the CS50x for Indonesian Teachers as the final project. This final project created in a group mode consisting of 3 people:
1. Raden Nur Tsawaabit Faheim Yasin
2. Dwi Septiani
3. Mardiyati Hidayah

The website created to help people who are going to start travelling to Indonesia, especially to visit Banten Province. We know that travelling helps to connect people and build social bonding. In the present time, travelling is the best way to get out of a busy schedule. It becomes a crucial part of life and a good remedy for stress, anxiety, and depression. People now explore the world and want to meet different people, cultures, and cuisine. 

In this modern era, one gets an idea online, and travel is not separate from that. For that reason, we want to create an informational website of wonderful destination tourism in Banten (one of provinces in Indonesia), a place where we stay. It helps to enrich foreign tourists by ensuring adequate information.

We made 5 main menus:
1. Home
2. About
3. Service
4. Destination
   a. Banten Lama
   b. Taman Nasional Ujung Kulon
   c. Saba Budaya Banten
   d. Pantai Anyer

   f. Pantai Carita
   g. Pulau Umang
   h. Little Green Canyon
   i. Gunung Pulosari
